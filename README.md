Ideas:
  1. Clustering: What are the biomes? Do certain species of pokemon spawn together?
  2. Association rules: GIven that we've observed a particular set of pokemon spawning, can we predict what rares might also spawn?
  3. Sequence mining (assumes census data which we probably don't have): given the pokemon we've observed, can we predict what the next spawn will be?
  4. Migration analysis: Are there any inferences we can draw about how spawns are likely to change after a migration? Can we predict what spawn points will change and what the new pokemon might be?
